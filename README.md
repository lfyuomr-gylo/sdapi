# Unofficial SpanishDict API
`sdapi` provides an unofficial node.js API to get translations and conjugations from SpanishDict.com.


## Installation
```
npm install
npm run build
```

## CLI
There is a dummy CLI `bin/spanishdict` to query SpanishDict.com for words and phrases translations. The results are simply stringified and dumped to the console.
